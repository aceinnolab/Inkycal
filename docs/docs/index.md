# Inkycal Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Inkycal** — a modular, customizable information dashboard for **Raspberry Pi–powered E-Paper displays**.

Inkycal turns your E-Paper display into a beautiful always-on dashboard capable of showing:

- Calendars & schedules  
- Weather forecasts  
- Task lists  
- Photos & images  
- Custom Python-based modules  

All rendered as crisp, low-power e-paper graphics.
