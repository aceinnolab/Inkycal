# About Inkycal
<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aceisace/Inky-Calendar/development/Gallery/logo.png" width="800">

Inkycal is a python3 software for selected E-Paper displays.
It's open-source (non-commercially), fully modular, user friendly and even runs
well even on the Raspberry Pi Zero. Inkycal even has a web-UI which takes
care of adding your details! No more editing files, Yay :partying_face:

The main idea behind Inkycal was to create a dashboard that blends in well
in it's environment and shows you all information without you having to look
them up. Several built-in modules help you stay organised by:
* providing the weather forecast for the full week or next few hours
* getting the latest news from ATOM/RSS feeds
* showing your iCalendar agenda, which may be syncronised with your phone
* showing a monthly Calendar which may also show events synced with Google etc.
* fetch some jokes form the web to help you smile :)

What's more? It's compatible with third party modules, if something is missing,
you can write your own module and share it with the community.

Inkycal has a friendly and helpful community on Discord in case you're in
a pinch setting up Inkycal. Noobs welcome too of course!

Inkycal is developed mainly by [aceisace](https://github.com/aceisace) - a
university student and a few other developers in their free time.
Open source means we work for nothing, but it doesn't mean we don't need
anything. We invest a large amount of time, effort and coffee to develop
Inkycal.
